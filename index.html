                    <p>Worked with a multidisciplinary team to create NitrateX, a two in one solution to removing nitrates and trash from the Chesapeake Bay by targeting them at the source. Teams were tasked with identifying an environmental problem and developing a solution. Data on the issue was collected through interviews and surveys, and from there potential solutions were brainstormed and made into a prototype. The product consists of nets placed at the mouth of every storm drain to catch trash and ion filters at the exits to remove nitrates. Nitrate-selective resin beads are placed inside the filter, and they remove nitrates through a strong ion-base reaction where nitrates in the water are swapped with chloride ions inside the resin. The housing for the filter is made from aluminum as it won't corrode or rust.<br><br>Relevant skills: Design thinking, Prototyping, Creativity/Innovation, Professional communication, Teamwork, New product design, Design evaluation</p>

                    <p>During the creation of VestaAIO, one of the main sites the bot was developed for, Footlocker, used Akamai Bot Manager to protect their checkout flow. To develop a solution, the script was first deobfuscated, using an online resource. Then, various browser data that was required by the script was collected from our peers, such as user agents, canvas fingerprints, and time to compute simple arithmetic. Akamai also takes in user’s mouse movement to judge if it is human like or not, and to combat that an algorithm was designed that utilizes Bezier curves to simulate smooth mouse movements. The data needed to be sent in a post request in order to receive a valid cookie, so a GoLang requests library using uTLS was created to use HTTP2 to send requests with a custom TLS fingerprint.<br><br>Relevant skills: Reverse Engineering, Networking, Web Development</p>
